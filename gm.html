        <h4>Inspiration:</h4>
        <p>
            As a transfer student going into my first semester at Georgia Tech, I always heard classes were going to be
            more difficult overall. While I was still pleased with my performance, the semester would've been less
            stressful if I knew exactly how much a certain quiz/test was impacting my grade. At the time, I also just
            started teaching myself JavaScript, so why not kill two birds with one stone?
        </p>
        <h4>The Process:</h4>
        <p>
            I simply wanted to first have the application work. The user inputs grades, and out spits a grade.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the basic functions down, I focused on improving the user experience. Having to manually set each grade
            before calculating was annoying aswell as having to type a negative value instead of leaving it blank for
            grades you don't have.
        </p>

            The idea of having multiple classes came up, and it seemed like a wonderful idea. Since I didn't initially
            plan for it, I had to restructure most of my code to implement this feature.
        </p>
        <img class="picture" src="gm-images/6.21-gm.PNG">
        <p>
            With all the functions properly working, it was now time to start planning how I wanted the UI to look. I
            initially
            started planning with the desktop view for no particular reason.
        </p>
        <img class="picture" src="gm-images/6.22-UI-Planning-Desktop.jpg">
        <p>
            I implemented the design with a responsive grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the project was starting to look pretty neat on the desktop, it looked horrible on my mobile device.
            While it did scale, all of the information was now bunched up and hard to read. It was a complete mess. I
            had to plan a UI with mobile in mind.
        </p>

        <img class="picture" src="gm-images/6.22-gm-mobile.PNG">
        <p>
            From there on, I made various improvements to the UI and added a notes section.
